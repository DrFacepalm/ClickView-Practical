Unfortunately, I dont believe this code will be 'up and running' any time soon. Many of the tasks were out of my scope of knowledge so I did my best to create the API as required and save the video data as required. Im sorry I could not offer more.

To 'hypothetically' run the server, use the command
node Prog.js

Files:
Prog.js -> the main file that wil run and deal with the server
CRUD_API.js -> The API with all the required methods
video.js -> the Video class file
